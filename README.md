Misc Tools and Helpers
======================

The intention of this project is to host various tools and helpers,
like the Alpine Linux build and test docker container.  Which is
used in other projects of mine, e.g. [the SMCRoute project][1].

The container is automatically updated on pushes to the main branch,
tagged `:latest`, and on releases, tagged `:vX.Y.Z`.
